No profiles of caffeine under this interaction were available, but [Balogh 1995](#5-References) reported a 55% decrease in caffeine CL due to ethinylestradiol co-administration and report AUCR and CmaxR.

For the time-dependent innhibition, the `Kinact` value of 100 1/min has shown better results that 200 1/min.
